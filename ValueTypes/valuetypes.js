/* The most common value types that you're likely to encounter are Strings and Numbers
Strings are like sentences, JavaScript understands strings by using quote marks
Double quotes ("") or single ('') can be used to define a string, but you have to make sure
that you're consistent. That is if you use single quotes to open a string, do not end the string
with a double quote, JavaScript will not be able to understand.

You can use both double and single quote in one string; 
    for example

      //  var htmlsnippet = '<h2 class="special">A very important headline</h2>';
      
    alert(4+7);

    /*for numbers, you need not use the quotes otherwise JavaScript will take the value to be
    a string*/
