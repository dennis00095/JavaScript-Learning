# How Variables are named

When naming variables you have to be careful not to use reserved words. These words are called _**keywords**_.

    for example the __Var__ keyword cannot be used as a variable since it is already reserved for JavaScript.

1. When naming variables, you should never start with a number.

   for example a word like _**123score**_ is not acceptable, but **score123** is acceptable.

2. Names can only contain _**letters, numbers, \$, and underscore(\_)**_.
